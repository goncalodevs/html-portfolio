<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This will the third year I have been in the IT world, The first 2 years, I have worked in Help Desk, but for the latter I have decided to pursue Web Dev skills so I can achieve the ServiceNow Developer position that is currently open at my company.</p>

<p>I have traveled many places (4 Continents so far) and while doing so, I have learned 4 different languages, tried many different cuisines, and had beautiful shared experiences with locals. But the dearest part of traveling was meeting my soulmate and starting a family with her as my wife. </p>
