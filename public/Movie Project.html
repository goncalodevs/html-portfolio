<h1>The Best Movies According to Gon&ccedil;aloDevs</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time are:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>

<p>Martin Scorsese created a masterpiece and casted some of the best talent Hollywood had, which translated to a oscar-nominated, beautifully orchestrated, motion picture.</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>

<p>This is one of my childhood favorites. It is a timeless movie, and will be enjoyed for many years to come, even if just in the Gon&ccedil;aloDevs household!</p>

<h3>Birdman</h3>

<p>Wonderfully produced movie, where the director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu achieved an illusion of a one single shot take.</p>
